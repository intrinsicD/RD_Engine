# A basic opaque PBR material for standard meshes.
name: Basic Opaque Material

# Path to the shader file relative to the assets directory.
# The loader will resolve this to find the GLSL source.
shader: shaders/basic_lit.glsl

# --- GPU Pipeline State ---
# Defines how the mesh is rendered.
pipeline:
  cullMode: Back      # Options: Back, Front, None
  polygonMode: Fill  # Options: Fill, Line, Point
  depthTest: true    # Enable depth testing
  depthWrite: true   # Write to the depth buffer

# --- Material Parameters ---
# These values will be uploaded to a Uniform Buffer Object (UBO).
parameters:
  baseColor: [1.0, 0.7, 0.2, 1.0] # RGBA
  metalness: 0.1
  roughness: 0.8

# --- Texture Maps ---
# Maps a sampler name in the shader to a texture asset file.
textures:
  albedoMap: "textures/Checkerboard.png"
  normalMap: "textures/default_normal.png" # Example for later
  #roughnessMap: "textures/my_roughness_map.png" # Example for later
