# ===================================================================
# RDE Default Material
#
# This is the fallback material used for any mesh that does not have
# a material assigned. It uses a standard PBR metallic/roughness
# workflow.
#
# You can copy this file to create new materials.
# ===================================================================

name: Default

# The shader that implements the rendering logic for this material.
# 'basic_lit.glsl' is assumed to be a PBR-compliant shader.
shader: shaders/basic_lit.glsl

# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Pipeline State
# Defines how the GPU should be configured when rendering this material.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
pipeline:
  # cullMode: Which side of the triangles to discard.
  # Options: Back, Front, None
  cullMode: Back

  # polygonMode: How to draw the triangles.
  # Options: Fill, Line, Point
  polygonMode: Fill

  # depthTest: If true, objects will correctly occlude each other.
  depthTest: true

  # depthWrite: If true, this object will write to the depth buffer,
  # allowing it to occlude other objects drawn after it.
  # (Transparent materials would set this to false).
  depthWrite: true

# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Material Parameters
# These are the intrinsic properties of the surface.
# They are uploaded to a Uniform Buffer for the shader to use.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
parameters:
  # The base color of the material (albedo), in RGBA format.
  # This is a neutral grey, which is a good default.
  baseColor: [0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 1.0]

  # How metallic the surface is. 0.0 = dielectric (plastic, wood),
  # 1.0 = fully metallic (gold, steel).
  metalness: 0.0

  # How rough the surface is. 0.0 = perfectly smooth (mirror),
  # 1.0 = fully rough (chalk, clay). A value of 0.5 is a good
  # neutral default.
  roughness: 0.5

  # Emissive factor. Makes the object appear to glow.
  # Default is black (no emission).
  emissiveFactor: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Texture Maps
# These link shader samplers to texture files.
# The engine will look for these textures relative to the assets/ directory.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
textures:
  # The albedoMap multiplies with the baseColor parameter.
  # A 1x1 white texture means "don't change the baseColor".
  # This is a critical default for PBR.
  albedoMap: "textures/default_white.png"

  # The normalMap provides fine surface detail.
  # A 1x1 flat normal texture (RGB 128,128,255) means "the surface is perfectly flat".
  normalMap: "textures/default_normal.png"

  # Metal/Roughness/AO map. Often packed into one texture (R=Metal, G=Roughness, B=AO).
  # A 1x1 texture with our default values is a good fallback.
  metalRoughnessMap: "textures/default_metal_rough.png"
